{"name":"Multi-Party Capacity Constrained Route Planning","tagline":"Civilian Evacuation and Route Planning Coordinated with Emergency Response","body":"### Welcome to our project page.\r\nEvacuation Route Planning (ERP) has grown ever more imperative due to the increasing impact of natural disasters and threats of terrorism on modern infrastructure. To help mitigate loss due to these and similar large-scale situations such as nuclear disasters, ERP tasks are becoming more complex. Other complicating elements include increasing population densities, larger structures within urban environments served by multifaceted transportation networks. Because of the multitude of factors, all driving the problem toward greater scales, the ability to handcraft ideal ERPs has become nearly infeasible. This has led emergency planners to turn to artificial intelligence algorithms to quickly generate optimal paths for large-scale civilian evacuations under multiple scenarios. Multi-Party Capacity Constrained Route Planning (MPCCRP) is project geared towards developing a modified version of the original CCRP algorithm for multiple parties with separate objectives. Such scenarios include civilian evacuation route planning with additional emergency response coordination.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nOur original paper of our supporting work in developing MPCCRP can be found here:  \r\n[Documentation](https://github.com/ruffsl/CS6601P1/tree/master/Documentation)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/ruffsl/CS6601P1/master/Documentation/Figures/CCRP_grid_2d_5x5_Evac_Before_1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 20px;\"/>\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nOur original Python code and examples can also be found at our GitHub repo:  \r\n[MPCCRP Repo](https://github.com/ruffsl/CS6601P1)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n[Ruffin White](http://about.me/ruffin) (@ruffsl)  \r\nVarun Murali (@pjhyett) \r\n\r\n### References  \r\nS.

This code requires:
python 2.7: http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/
ipython: http://ipython.org/install.html
ipython Notebook: http://ipython.org/notebook.html


Basically what comes with Continuum's python tool
Anaconda: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/
    OR! more specifically here:
    matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/
    pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/
    numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
        NetworkX: http://networkx.github.io/


But if you're feeling lazy,
go ahead and get a free Python cloud server with
Wakari: https://wakari.io/
and you'll have everything you'll need,
and can run the code and see the results with just a web browser.
I would recommend this,
as that is what I've written this code with.
